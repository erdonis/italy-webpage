# italy-webpage

This is my second project on The Odin Project. This project was more focused on the CSS and the design of the page. The project was to make a webpage using knowledge we've learned so far including FLexbox. I decided to make a landing page for an Italy "blog". It could also be used for a travel agency etc. As it was only a webpage, I only used one html file "index.html" and linked there the style.css file. Also added a couple of images which i also linked to the html file.
